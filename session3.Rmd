| Organization of systematic reviews | [Covidence](https://www.covidence.org) can help you organize your research studies. You can screen abstracts and extract data in a systematic manner. Please note that the free version of Covidence has a limit on the number of records you can include in your synthesis. An alternative may be [Rayyan](https://www.rayyan.ai). | 
| Conducting a meta-analysis | [*metafor*](https://www.metafor-project.org/doku.php/metafor) is an easy to use *R* package. It can help you conduct a meta-analysis and has an extensive online documentation, including a lot of [*tips & tricks*](https://www.metafor-project.org/doku.php/tips). Check out the recommended readings for additional information: Bruecker et al. (2021) provides an overview of meta-analyses and an annotated reading list. For details on how to conduct a meta-analysis in R, check out the guide by Harrer et al. (2021).|
